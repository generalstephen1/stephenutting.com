If anything, this game, while not very good, is a show of just how much I can learn in a short period of time. The game is a 3rd person hack'n'slash style game. The backstory is that the Zompocalypse has occurred and there are no humans left. Zombies must turn to cannibalism or they will inevitably perish. However, due to the biological makeup of the zombies in question, they have gained the ability to tear limbs off other zombies to increase their attack power. This is balanced with a steadily decreasing 'life force', and the more arms you have, the faster it decreases. This is a neverending survival game where you must simply last as long as you can to keep your score high.</p>"
